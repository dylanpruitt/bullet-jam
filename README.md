# bullet-jam
A bullet hell game made with Love2D (code ported from [html-bullet-jam](https://github.com/dylanpruitt/html-bullet-jam) and modified to work with Lua).

Currently in development for release on Steam - CD keys are available for testing.

## What is this game about?
This project aims to take bullet hell gameplay, and add new weapons that allow players to tackle a variety of different situations.
For instance, one weapon named Switcheroo swaps the player with the closest NPC. Players can use this to get past enemies in dangerous spots, as well as a variety of other uses:

## Music
Although I was unable to add sound to the game this semester because of my workload, I do have a few unfinished MP3 files of what the game's soundtrack would look like.
You can find some of the music [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fICWQAyGZOT6R2wDN6u9tIsk1GbN6QUr?usp=sharing).
